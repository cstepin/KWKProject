# KWKProject
This project is a resource page for students interested in STEM. Pages contain information for the students--various resources to learn about programming and scholarship opportunities--as well as an interactive to-do list to stay focused.

When a user enters the website they are directed to choose any of the pages, as indicated from the toolbar above.
