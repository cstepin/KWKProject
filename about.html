    <p> Christina Stepin is an 18-year-old innovator with a passion for social justice. Having had only one computer science class offered at her own school, Christina was inspired to ensure that other girls interested in computer science could pursue the subject to the fullest extent. Therefore, Christina joined the Glow and Grow team. In her free time, Christina enjoys baking, biking, and entertaining her two cats. </p>
